# Android Ticktacktoe Mobile Game
This is a tick-tack-toe game with some very basic AI for Android devices, written in the Java programming language.
<br>
I have tried to keep the code as simple and well documented as possible, to make it more beginner-friendly.

## Notes:
1. This project is still a Work In Progress (WIP), but is close to being complete.
2. We use an altered form of the miniMax algorithm (often used in game development) to act as our AI.
3. The app's starting screen title is a joke, this is **not** a bitcoin miner. Reading through the code will make this clear.
4. I will add a release for the APK to this repository, once the project has been completed. You can, alternatively, clone the repo and build the project on your machine, once you've checked the code for any malicious activity or bugs.
